# 🐍 Python Snake Game  

Welcome to my **Python Snake Game** project! 🎮 This is a modern, fun take on the classic arcade game we all know and love. Built using **Python's Turtle Graphics**, the game features smooth controls, colorful food mechanics, and a high-score tracking system.

## 🎉 Features
- **Smooth Snake Movement**: Use arrow keys to guide the snake across the screen.
- **Dynamic Food Spawning**: Random colors and locations every time food is eaten.
- **High-Score Tracking**: Keeps your highest score saved even when you reset the game.
- **Game Reset & Collision Detection**: Game restarts if the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- **Simple UI**: Easy to understand, engaging to play.

🕹️ How to Play
Use Arrow Keys to move the snake:

Up Arrow: Move up
Down Arrow: Move down
Left Arrow: Move left
Right Arrow: Move right
Objective: Guide the snake to eat food, grow longer, and achieve the highest score possible.

Game Over: If the snake collides with a wall or its tail, the game resets.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Power-ups: Add special food items with unique effects.
Multiplayer Mode: Implement a second player option.
Obstacles: Make the game more challenging with walls and barriers.
🏅 High Score Tracking
The game stores your high score in a local text file (high_score.txt) so you can track your progress over time!

🌈 Dependencies
This game uses only the Turtle Graphics module, which is included with Python by default. No additional libraries are required!
